# EllipticCurve-PRNG

This project hopes to explore new ways to generate pseudorandom numbers using elliptic curves. The original idea is based off of a [paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-0-387-35413-2_12.pdf) by Lap-piu Lee and Kwok-wo Wong.

The statistical randomness testing suite was taken from NIST SP 800-22. The testing suite and information on it can be found [here] (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software).
